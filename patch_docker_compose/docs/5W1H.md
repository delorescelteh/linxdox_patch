# patch_docker_compose — 5W1H

## Why (為什麼要 patch)
- Baseline Docker component on Linxdot/OpenWrt may not match production needs for a full ChirpStack stack.
- We need a deterministic, recoverable, operator-friendly way to run and update the container stack.

## What (要改什麼)
In scope:
- Docker daemon config and storage layout (e.g. `data_root` / log policy)
- Boot/start scheme for container stack (compose-like workflow)
- Basic guardrails: disk usage, log rotation/prune policy
- Apply + verify scripts

Out of scope (phase 1):
- Full ChirpStack service tuning (will be handled after stack installation)

## Who (誰執行)
- Owner: Living
- Operator: Delores (OpenClaw)

## When (什麼時候)
- Started: 2026-02-10
- Applied: TBD

## Where (在哪裡)
- Target devices: Linxdot/OpenWrt devices running Docker (baseline reference: 192.168.0.88)
- Patch folder: `patch_docker_compose/`

## How (怎麼做)
- Baseline capture: gather UCI, init scripts, runtime status, disk usage into `baseline/`.
- Design: decide stack location + boot entrypoint + operational commands.
- Implementation: apply scripts under `tools/`.
- Verification: verify scripts + reboot test; collect evidence under `evidence/`.
